* About this site

This is the github homepage for me. [[http://xzpeter.org][Here]] is my Chinese blog which you may come and see over. This site is a little bit different from the chinese blog: 

1. It's hosted on github so that *it is totally free* :)
2. It will be all written in *english* .
3. The topic may be very small stuffs, like some /HOWTO/ tips on using Linux, or so on. So more like a NOTE page here. 
4. Totally *plain text* here.
5. I can commit my blog with the help of *git* . So it is fast. (that one, I use [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]], which is also fast :) )
   
Hope you enjoy.
